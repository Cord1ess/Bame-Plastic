/// Keeps the world near the origin so the endless road never drives the bus into far-from-origin float
/// imprecision (jitter, unstable sphere physics, shimmering seams). When the BUS passes `threshold`
/// metres from origin (horizontally), every root object — road, stops, traffic, the detached physics
/// sphere — is shifted by -busPos so the bus snaps back near 0,0,0. Velocities are unaffected by a
/// position shift, so motion is seamless; the shift is invisible because the whole world moves together.
///
/// Spline-safe and chunk-independent: it notifies systems that cache WORLD positions (the road
/// generator's walk cursors, the stop spawner's distance anchors) so they shift too. Attach anywhere
/// (camera is fine); it finds the bus itself.
